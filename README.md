🎙️ Image to Text to Audio

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline that transforms an image into spoken audio. It works in three main steps: extracting text from an image, cleaning the extracted text, and finally converting it into audio speech.

✨ Features

    🔹 Extracts text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
    🔹 Processes and formats the extracted text for better readability.
    🔹 Converts the text into clear, natural-sounding audio using Text-to-Speech technology.
    🔹 Provides an end-to-end solution from image input to audio output.

⚙️ Requirements

    🔹 Python installed on your system.
    🔹 Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab for running the notebook.
    🔹 Libraries for image processing, OCR, and text-to-speech.
    🔹 Tesseract OCR installed and configured on your system.

🛠️ How It Works

    🔹 Load an image into the system.
    🔹 Extract text from the image using OCR.
    🔹 Preprocess and clean the extracted text.
    🔹 Convert the text into audio and save it as an output file.

📌 Example
  
    Input: An image containing the text “Hello World”.
    Output: An audio file that speaks the words “Hello World”.

🌍 Applications

    🔹 Making written content accessible for visually impaired users.
    🔹 Automating the process of reading documents aloud.
    🔹 Assisting in language learning by converting text into speech.
    🔹 Creating multimedia content that combines visual and audio formats.

🚀 Future Enhancements

    🔹 Support for multiple languages in OCR and text-to-speech.
    🔹 Improved text preprocessing for better accuracy.
    🔹 Real-time image-to-speech application.
    🔹 Development of a user-friendly interface or web-based tool.
